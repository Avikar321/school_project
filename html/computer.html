<h1>Introduction</h1><br>
A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic 
or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers
 can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable
  computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a 
  nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software,
   and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of 
   computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or 
   computer cluster.</p><br>
<p>
 A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. 
Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included,
 as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as 
 general-purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as 
 smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of computers and 
 users.</p><br>

Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual
 instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient
  times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to
   automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More 
   sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early
    20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed 
    during World War II, both electromechanical and using thermionic valves. The first
     semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based 
     MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in 
     the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution 
     in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing 
     dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace
      (Moore's law noted that counts doubled every two years), leading to the Digital
       Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.
